# About ORSHIN
It is common wisdom that cyber security is only as strong as the weakest link in a chain. Therefore, the main challenge is to identify the critical points of IoT infrastructure. To address this issue, ORSHIN is creating the first generic and integrated methodology, called trusted lifecycle, to develop secure network devices based on open-source components while managing their entire lifecycle. ORSHIN's trustworthy lifecycle consists of different phases (design, implementation, evaluation, installation, maintenance and retirement) that form a chain of trust. This lifecycle defines how the safety objectives are translated into policies for defined phases. Using this holistic view, ORSHIN will address critical links, reduce threats and improve security of open-source devices.
